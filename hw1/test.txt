a. Jack think the programming is the essentially a design activity and only final and true representation of the design is the sourcr code itself.

b. Due to the ever-increased updated technologya and ever-changing methodologies, the more rigor standards do not conform and put hurdles towards the software technology development.


c. He think the Objecte oriented language like C++ make it easier to design software and program at the same time.

d. The complexity exists within the
software design itself, within the software organization of the company, and within the
industry as a whole. Software design is very similar to systems design. It can span multiple
technologies and often involves multiple sub-disciplines. Software specifications tend to be
fluid, and change rapidly and often, usually while the design process is still going on.
Software development teams also tend to be fluid, likewise often changing in the middle of
the design process. In many ways, software bears more resemblance to complex social or organic system than to hardware.All of this makes software design a difficult and error
prone process. None of this is original thinking, but almost 30 years after the software
engineering revolution began, software development is still seen as an undisciplined art
compared to other engineering professions.
